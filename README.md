# HYCU example REST api scripts
## Project Notes

**Author:** Carlos Talbot

The scripts in this folder are examples that can be used with HYCU's REST api. All scripts request an initial token that can be used as a bearer token.

The script list_users_by_apikey is an example script that allows you to use a preconfigured API key from the UI. This allows you to store the script without a username and passowrd. The API key can also be configured to expired after some time.
